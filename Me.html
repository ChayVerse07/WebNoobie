<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
Well.. I'm Sai Chayank. I'm pretty much just a kid who likes to code. I'm a student at the GLEC. 
I'm majoring in Computer Science. I'm a huge fan of anime and manga. I'm also a huge fan of video games.
I pretty much study only beacuse I want to get a good job and earn tons of money along with experience.
